# 115_Personal_Dataset_Project
The reposition contain the files and code for my personal data set project. 

## Motivation
I really enjoy watching football and some of the biggest controversies on Sundays can come from penalties. 

## Figure 1

Each of the points in the figure above represent an NFL Team and they lie on the scatterplot in relation to how many penalties were recieved at home games versus away games. This data is based on penalties received during the 2020 NFL Regular Season.
